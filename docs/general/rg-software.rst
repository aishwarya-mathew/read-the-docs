Rogues Gallery Software
=======================

The Rogues Gallery testbed supports multiple different software stacks for different novel architectures. This page collects some high level information and serves as a landing page for using software on the testbed.

Modules
-------
Most software on the testbed is available using "modulefiles", which allow you to load and unload packages to run specific versions of software. Modulefiles specify the correct path variables for a given software package and help to resolve differences between packages. See `this page <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/general/modulefiles.html>`__ for more details on using modules with the Rogues Gallery. Each hardware resource should also have some commands on available software modules for the resource.
