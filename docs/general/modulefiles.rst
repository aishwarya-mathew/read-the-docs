Modulefile Examples
===================

Most software on the testbed is available using "modulefiles", which allow you to load and unload packages to run specific versions of software. Modulefiles specify the correct path variables for a given software package and help to resolve differences between packages. See `this page <>`__ for more details on using modules with the Rogues Gallery.

Key commands to remember:

- `module avail`
- `module load/unload <modulename>`

Modulefile Resources
=======================
-  `NERSC Lmod User Training <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/past-training-events/2021/lmod-user-training/>`__ - contains a Github tutorial based on Docker that goes into the basic usage of modules.
