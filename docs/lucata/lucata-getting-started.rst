=================================

The Rogues Gallery hosts two distinct systems from Lucata (formerly known as Emu Technology): The Gen1 Emu Chick, an 8-node desktop-style system, and the Lucata Pathfinder, a four-chassis system with 16 nodes and 24 cores in each node for a total of 768 cores across the Pathfinder cluster.

Latest Updates
--------------
* The 24.01 Pathfinder tools have been released and made the default on the Rogues Gallery testbed. See `the 3.3 Programming Guide here <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/rg-lucata-pathfinder/blob/3c24efe56e9442207a8058a8b233d05bef53ef57/docs/pathfinder/Lucata-Pathfinder-Programming-Guide-v3.3.pdf>`__ (RG user account login to GT Github required) for the latest information on this toolset release.

Suggested Background and First Steps
------------------------------------
We suggest that you familiarize yourself with the Cilk programming language and Cilk syntax using the `OpenCilk tutorials <https://www.opencilk.org/doc/tutorials/introduction-to-cilk-programming/>`__.


Using the EMU simulation and compiler tools
-------------------------------------------

The current toolset, documentation, and examples are available on the rg-emu-dev VM and other nodes as a module. Note that it is recommended to use the latest version of the Pathfinder toolset.


* **rg-login.crnch.gatech.edu**: primary login VM for Rogueâ€™s Gallery. Use this VM to log in to another node for testing and simulation from off campus.
* **rg-emu-dev.crnch.gatech.edu**: VM for **Lucata compilation and simulation**
* **hawksbill.crnch.gatech.edu**: Large-memory, general-purpose node for larger Lucata-based simulations
* **pf<0-3>.crnch.gatech.edu**: Lucata Pathfinder chassis for HW execution

Lucata Workflow

When getting started, we highly recommend checking out the `Lucata Pathfinder Programming Manual <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/rg-lucata-pathfinder/blob/3c24efe56e9442207a8058a8b233d05bef53ef57/docs/pathfinder/Lucata-Pathfinder-Programming-Guide-v3.3.pdf>`__ (*requires GT Github login*) and read through Chapters 1,2,3, 5.1, 6, and 7. This will give you a basic understanding of the Cilk-based workflow and Lucata-specific APIs and tools. 

As shown in the figure above, the suggested Lucata workflow combines 1) x86 functionality testing, 2) simulation of code on a VM, 3) execution on a single node of the Pathfinder system, and 4) execution on multiple nodes and chassis.

1. Compile your code on rg-emu-dev using <memoryweb.h>  and emu-cc.sh to target x86 execution. This will run the Cilk code and emulate any data allocations specified by the Lucata APIs.
2. Simulate code on rg-emu-dev. Do debugging and initial verification here but note that simulation is slow! If you need to use a machine with more memory you can use hawksbill.crnch.gatech.edu
3. Profile your code with the simulator for small input sets.
4. Make a reservation on the Google Calendar for the Pathfinder to run jobs. We also use our Slack channel to reserve time on the Pathfinder. 

See `this page <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/lucata/lucata-pathfinder-execution.html>`__ for examples of running on the Pathfinder hardware.

5. Run your job on a single Pathfinder node (**SN<0-7>**) and verify correctness. 
6. Run your job on a single Pathfinder chassis (8 nodes PF<0-1>).
7. Run your job on multiple Pathfinder chassis (2 chassis).


Tutorials and Training
----------------------

Please check out the recent `Pathfinder tutorial <https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/lucata-pathfinder-tutorial>`__for official training material for the Pathfinder systems. 

There are also some microbench examples and related tools `shared in a Github repo <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-microbench-mirror>`__ (requires GT login). Please feel free to branch and fork as makes sense for your research.
