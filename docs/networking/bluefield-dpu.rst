NVIDIA's BlueField Data Processing Unit has both a high-speed InfiniBand/Ethernet interconnect and on-board DRAM and Arm CPU cores. Notably, this is one of the first SmartNIC devices that can run an on-board operating system in "host" mode. 

Acknowledgments
===============
Dr. Young and Dr. Bryngelson have received several BF2 cards which are hosted in the Rogues Gallery via `NVIDIA's Academic Hardware Grant program <https://nvidia.my.site.com/HardwareGrant/s/Application>`__.

Current Status
==============

BUGS / Feature Requests
-----------------------
- Some cards are likely to move hosts as we reimage machines to better support running DPUs.

Networking Configuration
==================

The management ports on the BlueField-3 DPUs are connected to a 1 Gigabit Ethernet switch, while the network ports are connected to our `Cisco 9336 100 Gigabit Ethernet switch <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9336c-fx2-switch/model.html#~tab-specs>`__.


Key Resources to Get Started
============================
- Check out the recent `Supercomputing 2023 tutorial on SmartNICs <https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/>`__ for an overview of different ways to use BlueFields.
    - See an example of using a `heterogeneous workflow on the host and DPU <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/networking/bf-heterogeneous-workflow.html>`__
    - Check out recent work by BSC researchers on `using OpenMP offloading with BlueField DPUs <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/networking/dpu-openmp-offload.html>`__
- See the `DOCA SDK page <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/networking/nvidia-doca-sdk.html>`__ for information on using DOCA features with the BlueField devices.

How to Access BlueField Cards
=============================

As with most CRNCH resources, you need to either log in via the gateway node, rg-login, or access the system from the campus network via VPN or an on-campus connection.

To request an allocation using slurm, you can run the following for your desired resource:

.. code::

   //Request an allocation of 1 hr, partition rg-smart-nic, and specify the node name for the server with -w
   salloc -t 1:00:00 -p rg-smart-nic -w dash3-bf3
   //SSH to the resource
   ssh dash3-bf3
