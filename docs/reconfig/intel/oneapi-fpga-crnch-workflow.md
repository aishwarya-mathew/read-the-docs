# Using Intel OneAPI with CRNCH Rogues Gallery

Here we will detail how to run one of the Intel OneAPI samples as a guide for how to use the Intel FPGAs on the CRNCH Rogues Gallery.

We recommend selecting one of the official OneAPI DirectProgramming examples from [this repo](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/code-sample/explore-dpcpp-through-intel-fpga-code-samples.html). This workflow roughly follows the [`fpga_compile` example](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/C%2B%2BSYCL_FPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted/fpga_compile) from the code samples.

## General Workflow

1) Evaluate for functional correctness: Build your design for CPU and then for FPGA emulation
2) Check mapping to your target board: Look at the optimization report to see if your design fits.
3) Build a bitstream
4) Run the bitstream on your target board.
5) Profile your bitstream. 

### Which machines can support this flow?

| Server Name | Devices              | Specific Boards |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| flubber2    | Arria 10, Stratix 10 (S10) |  Bittware 385, Bittware 520N |
| flubber3    | Stratix 10 HBM, S10       |  Bittware 520N-MX, Intel S10 PAC               |
| flubber9    | Agilex               |   Bittware IA-840F              |
--------------------------------------------------------

## FPGA Emulation

First we request a "development" node to run CPU-based execution and simulation. Note that we can use OneAPI tools across different VMs and servers, so we do some basic testing and debugging using a VM with the appropriate tools. 

```
//Request a node from the rg-fpga-dev partition which has all the VMs
salloc -p rg-fpga-dev --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=2 --time=01:00:00
salloc: Pending job allocation 67109553
...
salloc: Granted job allocation 67109553
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes rg-fpga-dev1 are ready for job
gburdell@rg-fpga-dev1:~$
```

Then source the Intel OneAPI tools to compile your code:
```
. /tools/intel/oneapi/2023.0/setvars.sh
 
:: initializing oneAPI environment ...
   bash: BASH_VERSION = 4.4.20(1)-release
   args: Using "$@" for setvars.sh arguments: 
:: advisor -- latest
....
:: vtune -- latest
:: oneAPI environment initialized ::

```

Checkout the sample codes and jump to the loop unrolling example. We suggest using your `USERSCRATCH` directory since it is faster NVMe storage. 
```
$> cd USERSCRATCH
USERSCRATCH$> git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git
//Go to the top-level of the FPGA tutorial codes
$> cd oneAPI-samples/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/
//Go to the directory for the loop unrolling tutorial
$> cd Tutorials/Features/loop_unroll/
```

**NOTE:** Right now you have to manually edit the main source file to change how selector constructors are defined. This seems to be a bug with newer toolchains.

//Replace the `selector_v;` constructors as follows with `selector();`
```
loop_unroll$ vim src/loop_unroll.cpp
...
#if FPGA_SIMULATOR
  //auto selector = sycl::ext::intel::fpga_simulator_selector_v;
  auto selector = sycl::ext::intel::fpga_simulator_selector();
#elif FPGA_HARDWARE
  //auto selector = sycl::ext::intel::fpga_selector_v;
  auto selector = sycl::ext::intel::fpga_selector();
#else  // #if FPGA_EMULATOR
  //auto selector = sycl::ext::intel::fpga_emulator_selector_v;
  auto selector = sycl::ext::intel::fpga_emulator_selector();
#endif
```

You can check the available board support packages using the aoc command: 
```
aoc -list-boards
Board list:
  pac_a10 (default)
     Board Package: /net/projects/tools/x86_64/rhel-8/intel-oneapi/2023.0/compiler/2023.0.0/linux/lib/oclfpga/board/intel_a10gx_pac

  pac_s10
     Board Package: /net/projects/tools/x86_64/rhel-8/intel-oneapi/2023.0/compiler/2023.0.0/linux/lib/oclfpga/board/intel_s10sx_pac

  pac_s10_usm
     Board Package: /net/projects/tools/x86_64/rhel-8/intel-oneapi/2023.0/compiler/2023.0.0/linux/lib/oclfpga/board/intel_s10sx_pac
     Memories:      device, host
```

Then use cmake and make to run the FPGA simulation step targeting the S10 board

```
@rg-fpga-dev1:loop_unroll$ mkdir build && cd build
loop_unroll/build$ cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=pac_s10
-- Configuring the design with the following target: pac_s10
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: ... /oneAPI-samples/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/Tutorial...
```

And compile the emulation target with make
```
loop_unroll/build$ make fpga_emu
[ 50%] Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/loop_unroll.fpga_emu.dir/loop_unroll.cpp.o
[100%] Linking CXX executable ../loop_unroll.fpga_emu
[100%] Built target loop_unroll.fpga_emu
[100%] Built target fpga_emu
```

You can then run this emulated application and check its output.

```

```

## Simulation with ModelSim and Questa
Right now we don't support this step since we don't have these tools installed.

## Investigating the Optimization Report

As with the emulation step, you can generate an optimization report which provides useful statistics about your design for a particular board. This is run as follows:

```
loop_unroll/build$ make report
[ 50%] Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/loop_unroll_report.a.dir/loop_unroll.cpp.o
[100%] Linking CXX executable ../loop_unroll_report.a
[100%] Built target loop_unroll_report.a
[100%] Built target report
```

To look at your report on the CRNCH servers, it is probably easiest to use the Open OnDemand session. To do this, you can:

1) Log into the Open OnDemand instance at rg-ood.crnch.gatech.edu using the instructions [shared here](https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/general/open-on-demand.html).
2) Click on the Reconfig tab and select "Virtual Desktop".
3) Hit "Launch" on the next page and wait for your VNC session to start.
4) Then use the GUI to navigate to your report (it will be located at `loop_unroll/build/loop_unroll_report.prj/reports/report.html`).

## Building an FPGA Bitstream

Request an allocation on a larger server node with an appropriate amount of memory

```
salloc -p rg-intel-fpga-hw --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --nodelist flubber3 --time=01:00:00
```

## Profiling on FPGA with vTune 
This is a more advanced topic that we will add at a later date.
